Reset Jenkins Admin Password
Make a backup copy of a Jenkins config file (this step is important as after resetting the Jenkins admin password we would need to restore the previous settings):

$ cp /var/lib/jenkins/config.xml /var/lib/jenkins/config.xml.back
Open the config file /var/lib/jenkins/config.xml and disable the security:

<useSecurity>false</useSecurity>
Restart the Jenkins service:

$ systemctl restart jenkins
