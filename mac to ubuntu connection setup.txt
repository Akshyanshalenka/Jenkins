On your Ubuntu desktop, install a VNC server such as "TightVNC" or "RealVNC".
For example, to install TightVNC on Ubuntu, you can run the command: sudo apt-get install tightvncserver
Start the VNC server on your Ubuntu desktop by running the command: vncserver
Set a password for VNC when prompted.
Make a note of the IP address and port number displayed in the output of the vncserver command.
For example, the output may look like: New 'X' desktop is ubuntu:1
In this case, the IP address is "ubuntu" and the port number is "1".
On your Mac, open the "Screen Sharing" application.
In the menu bar, go to "File" > "Connect to Server".
Enter the VNC address in the format vnc://ip_address:port_number, replacing "ip_address" and "port_number" with the IP address and port number you noted earlier.
For example, the VNC address may look like: vnc://192.168.1.100:1
Click "Connect" and enter the VNC password when prompted.
If the connection is successful, you'll now see the Ubuntu desktop on your Mac screen.
Note that using VNC over the internet without encryption is insecure, so it's recommended to use a VPN or SSH tunnel to secure the connection.
